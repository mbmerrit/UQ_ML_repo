# Michael Merritt's Professional Repository 
### **Topics:** Machine Learning, Uncertainty Quantification, Optimization, Monte Carlo Methods
#### A public repository containing examples of my work in machine learning and uncertainty quantification from my time as a PhD student at **NC State University** and as an intern at **Sandia National Labs.** 

**Contents:** Using Jupyter notebooks, I present code and results from a variety of research projects. Feel free to take a look around!

*I am currently completing my PhD in Applied Math at NC State University, under the direction of Dr. Pierre Gremaud and Dr. Alen Alexanderian.*

*I am also a contractor at Sandia National Labs in the Department of Optimization and Uncertainty Quantification.*
