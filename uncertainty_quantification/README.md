# Uncertainty Quantification codes
My primary research area at NCSU has been in UQ, in various contexts and for various applications. UQ is the study of how randomness affects the use of mathematical models and how to reduce uncertainty to improve predictive capabilities. Uncertainty is ubiquitous and challenging in nearly all fields of science and engineering, making UQ a broadly applicable and dynamic field. 

My primary focus is in the sub-field of sensitivity analysis, the study of how these uncertainties contribute to the output of mathematical models. However, there are a variety of other disciplines within UQ, such as:
1. Uncertainty propagation
2. Inverse problems
3. Optimization under uncertainty
4. Bayesian approaches to UQ
5. Surrogate modeling
6. Dimension reduction

This repository will contain both introductory codes and a number of codes developed for active research projects.
